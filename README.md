# Self-Balancing-Robot

Self-balancing robots have garnered attention for their impressive stability on two wheels. This report outlines the design and analysis of a self-balancing robot developed using an L293D motor driver, an Arduino Uno, and an MPU6050. By leveraging these components, the robot can measure its tilt angle and adjust motor speeds via a Proportional-IntegralDerivative (PID) control algorithm. The mechanical and control aspects of the robot’s completion are discussed thoroughly. Test results evaluating the robot’s balancing performance are provided, along with suggestions for future design enhancements. This project presents an exciting endeavor in crafting self-balancing robots using easily obtainable components. Moreover, it sheds light on the critical role that control systems play in the realm of robotics, demonstrating their indispensable significance in real-world applications
